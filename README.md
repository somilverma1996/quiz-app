Steps to tackle the problem

I started from very basics and moved to problem
Divided the whole app into multiple small component and used together.
I made component as per the problem statement given eg:- there was a requirement for timer at the top, so I made a new component for that, I had to do navigation for question, made a separate for that too, so that is how I took the problem and break it into multiple components.
